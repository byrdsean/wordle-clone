# Wordle Clone

## Description

Custom Implementation of a Wordle Clone using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (no libraries).

This slider uses plain vanilla Javascript to replicate the "Wordle" game, owned by New York Times. You have six tries to try and guess a five letter word.

## How to use

Open the `dest/index.html` file.

## Built With

- Javascript
- CSS / Sass
- HTML

## Purpose of building this project

I wanted to challenge myself and build duplicate the popular "Wordle" game, _without_ the need for any Javascript libraries. I believe the only way to get better at programming is to learn by doing. Getting a sense of pride from accomplishing this build is just as worthwhile as the experience I gained.
